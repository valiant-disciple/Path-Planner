# Path-Planner
- A TensorFlow based object detection algorithm detects obstacles and creates a map. 
- A* algorithm based path planner finds the shortest path from start to end, while successfully avoiding obstacles.
- The first prototype is based on a basic ESP-32 based robot car, with a webcam providing the overhead image for mapping.

To run the entire pipeline, run main.py
